* get player's name
* generate a player object
* generate a list of math quiz questions (multiplication problems)
* set timers up
* begin question loop
* ask question
* get answer from user
* set time taken to question object
* set correct bool to question obj
* go next if more questions
* finalize
* show score
* best/worst numbers
